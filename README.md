# Python Learning Projects

Welcome to my Automate the Boring Stuff repo! 

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to track my progress and practice with Python programming as I work through different resources and exercises. Each project or file in this repository corresponds to a particular concept, chapter, or exercise from *Automate the Boring Stuff* or other sources, allowing me to consolidate my knowledge in one place.

## Structure

The repository is organized into folders, each representing a different section, chapter, or project:

- **Automate the Boring Stuff**: Code and exercises from *Automate the Boring Stuff with Python*.

## Requirements

Some of the code in this repository may require additional Python libraries. These libraries are listed in `requirements.txt`. To install them, you can run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
